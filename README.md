# nsw-rfs-majorincidents-geojson

The NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS) [publishes a GeoJSON feed of major incidents](http://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/news-and-media/stay-up-to-date/feeds), this project aims to make that feed more developer friendly.

You can either build this application into your own pipeline or use the hosted URL at https://www.beyondtracks.com/contrib/nsw-rfs-majorincidents.geojson (no service availability guarantees!), [preview it at geojson.io](http://geojson.io/#data=data:text/x-url,https://www.beyondtracks.com/contrib/nsw-rfs-majorincidents.geojson).

# Where is it used?

This pipeline has been built for [www.beyondtracks.com](https://www.beyondtracks.com) to provide information about bush fires nearby bushwalks.

# Features
## Access-Control-Allow-Origin

The upstream feed lacks the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header which means web applications aren't able to use the feed directly. This was reported to the NSW RFS on the 3rd of December 2015, and as of January 2018 the header still isn't present.

The sample crontab file allows you to mirror the RFS feed and serve it with your own HTTP server,  add the Access-Control-Allow-Origin HTTP header.

## Nested GeometryCollections

The upstream feed uses nested GeometryCollections, although allowed by the [GeoJSON spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946), the recommendation is they SHOULD be avoided.

These are converted to flat GeometryCollections when including different Geometry types or a multipart type where possible.

## Coordinate Precision

Although extra coordinate precision can help retain geometry shape even beyond the capture precision, the upstream feed uses 14 decimal places. Practically fire extents or geometry shape won't be more than 10m in accuracy so limiting to 4 decimal places will suffice.

## Overloaded description

The upstream feed overloads properties into the `description` field in a format like `KEY: Value <br />KEY: Value`. These are exploded out to make them easier to read in applications. The original overloaded description is dropped from the output.

## Machine Readable Tags with Documented Schema

This process slightly changes the schema making some tags more machine readable. The schema is fully documented below.

## ISO8601 Datetimes

The upstream feed uses dates in the format `3/01/2018 5:20:00 AM` and also `3 Jan 2018 16:20` in local time. These datetimes are converted into ISO8601 datetimes assuming the 'Australia/Sydney' time zone to avoid any ambiguities in interpretation.

## Winding Order

For extra assurances the GeoJSON winding order is enforced with https://github.com/mapbox/geojson-rewind.

# Usage

Install the Node dependencies with:

    yarn install

Run the script with:

    ./bin/nsw-rfs-majorincidents-geojson nsw-rfs-majorincidents.geojson

This will download the upstream feed, process it and save the resulting GeoJSON file at `nsw-rfs-majorincidents.geojson`.

# Schema
Each GeoJSON Feature represents a major incident. Each Feature may have multiple geometries using a GeometryCollection. For example both a point and a polygon showing a bushfire extent. Although so far every feature contains at a minimum a point geometry, without any documented guarantees about this consumers should accept features with no geometry or only a polygon geometry.

Each feature has a properties field as follows. Note that these vary from the upstream feed, the full list of possible values is unknown these are just the ones I've come across.

Key   | Type | Description | Example
------|------|-------------|---------
title | String | A short name used as the tile of this incident. Usually this is the name of a nearby road or geographic feature. | `Grain Valley Rd, Boggabri`
alert-level | String | Alert level of the incident, see #alert-level | `emergency-warning`, `watch-and-act`, `advice`, 'not-applicable`
status | String | Status of the incident, see #status | `out-of-control`, `being-controlled`, 'under-control'
guid | String | A globally unique identifier for this incident. Usually it is a non-publicly accessible URL | `https://incidents.rfs.nsw.gov.au/api/v1/incidents/285935`
pub-date | String | Datetime in ISO8601 of when the incident was first published | `2018-01-05T23:41:00+11:00`
updated | String | Datetime in ISO8601 of when the incident details were last updated | `2018-01-06T10:41:00+11:00`
responsible-agency | String | The name of the agency responsible for responding to the incident | `Rural Fire Service`, `NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service`.
size | String | The ground area which the incident affects | `2790 ha`
type | String | The type of incident | `bush-fire`, `medical`, `grass-fire`
fire | boolean | Indicates if this this incident a fire (`true`) or not (`false`) | `true`, `false`
council-area | String | Short name of the council area the incident falls in | `Wollongong`
location | String | A description of the location of the incident | `Coast Trk, Lilyvale, NSW 2508`, `150.79 -33.30`

## Status

Status Name | Status Identifier | Description
------------|-------------------|------------
Out of Control | `out-of-control` | A fire which is spreading on one or more fronts. Effective containment strategies are not in place for the entire perimeter.
Being Controlled | `being-controlled` | Effective strategies are in operation or planned for the entire perimeter.
Under Control | `under-control` | The fire is at a stage where fire fighting resources are only required for patrol purposes and major re-ignition is unlikely.

## Alert Level

Alert Level Name | Alert Level Identifier | Description
-----------------|------------------------|-------------
Emergency Warning| emergency-warning      | An Emergency Warning is the highest level of Bush Fire Alert. You may be in danger and need to take action immediately. Any delay now puts your life at risk.
Watch and Act    | watch-and-act          | There is a heightened level of threat. Conditions are changing and you need to start taking action now to protect you and your family.
Advice           | advice                 | A fire has started. There is no immediate danger. Stay up to date in case the situation changes.
Not Applicable   | not-applicable         |

# Warranty

The information in the RFS feed can affect life and property. Although the aim of this project is to make the RFS feed more safe, usable and reliable for data consumers, errors or omissions may be present and/or the upstream supplied data structure may change without any notice causing issues. Use at your own risk.
