# :fire: nsw-rfs-majorincidents-geojson

The NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS) [publishes a GeoJSON feed of major incidents](http://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/news-and-media/stay-up-to-date/feeds), this project aims to make that feed more developer friendly.

You can either build this application into your own pipeline or use the hosted URL at https://www.beyondtracks.com/contrib/nsw-rfs-majorincidents.geojson (no service availability guarantees), [preview it at geojson.io](http://geojson.io/#data=data:text/x-url,https://www.beyondtracks.com/contrib/nsw-rfs-majorincidents.geojson).

An archive of historical feed data is at [https://github.com/beyondtracks/nsw-rfs-majorincidents-archive](https://github.com/beyondtracks/nsw-rfs-majorincidents-archive).

## Where is it used?

This pipeline has been built for [www.beyondtracks.com](https://www.beyondtracks.com) and can be viewed live at [www.beyondtracks.com/map](https://www.beyondtracks.com/map) to provide information about bush fires near bushwalks.

# Features
## Access-Control-Allow-Origin

The upstream feed lacks the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header which means web applications aren't able to use the feed directly. This was reported to the NSW RFS on the 3rd of December 2015, and as of December 2019 the header still isn't present.

The sample crontab file allows you to mirror the RFS feed and serve it with your own HTTP server, adding the Access-Control-Allow-Origin HTTP header.

## Nested GeometryCollections

The upstream feed uses nested GeometryCollections, although allowed by the [GeoJSON spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946), the recommendation is they SHOULD be avoided.

Nested GeometryCollections are converted to flat GeometryCollections when they include different `Geometry` types or a multipart geometry where it's possible to avoid using a GeometryCollection at all.

Since some downstream applications can have trouble ingesting GeoJSON data with GeometryCollections of varying types, the option `--avoid-geometrycollections` is provided to explode these out into multiple Features.

## Coordinate Precision

Although extra coordinate precision can help retain geometry shape even beyond the capture precision, the upstream feed uses 14 decimal places. Practically fire extents or geometry shape won't be more than 10m in accuracy so limiting to 4 decimal places will suffice.

*Temporarily disabled due to issues where small valid polygons became invalid after truncation*

## Overloaded Description

The upstream feed overloads properties into the `description` field in the format `KEY: Value <br />KEY: Value`. These are exploded out to make them easier to machine read in applications. The original overloaded description is dropped from the output.

## Machine Readable Schema

Within [schema/](https://github.com/beyondtracks/nsw-rfs-majorincidents-geojson/tree/master/schema) are JSON files containing the values and descriptions for Status, Alert Level and Incident Type. These can be used within web applications to provide users more information about what these terms mean.

## ISO8601 Datetimes

The upstream feed uses dates in the format `3/01/2018 5:20:00 AM` in some places and `3 Jan 2018 16:20` in other places in local time. These datetimes are converted into ISO8601 datetimes assuming the 'Australia/Sydney' time zone to avoid any ambiguities in interpretation.

## Winding Order

For extra assurances the GeoJSON winding order is enforced with https://github.com/mapbox/geojson-rewind.

## Sorted features

You can control the order of features with `--sort=original|guid|pubdate`. The default is `original` which retains the original sort order, sorting by `guid` uses ascending order and `pubdate` uses chronological order.

## Removal of Internal Shared Borders
Around November 2019 it was observed some bushfire areas were being split into multiple `Polygon` geometries within the `GeometryCollection` for the incident. Since these are purely artificial, there is no compelling reason to include them, so we attempt to remove these by unioning multiple Polygons together with [polygon-clipping](https://github.com/mfogel/polygon-clipping).

![Shared internal borders](img/shared-borders.png)

Where the internal shared borders aren't perfectly touching you can try with the `--avoid-slivers` option (off by default) which tries to remove slivers less than 25m in width.

## ID

The `guid` is used as a numeric GeoJSON Feature ID.

# Usage

Install the Node dependencies with:

    yarn install

Run the script with:

    ./bin/nsw-rfs-majorincidents-geojson nsw-rfs-majorincidents.geojson

This will download the upstream feed, process it and save the resulting GeoJSON file at `nsw-rfs-majorincidents.geojson`.

Alternatively if you've pre-downloaded an upstream feed you can run:

    ./bin/nsw-rfs-majorincidents-geojson upstream.json output.geojson

## Options

* `--pretty-print` pretty print the output, otherwise output is minified
* `--avoid-geometrycollections` explode GeometryCollections out to multiple Features to avoid the use of GeometryCollections (handy for use in QGIS which doesn't support varying geometry types within a GeometryCollection, see https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/32747) (off by default)
* `--avoid-slivers` to try and remove narrow slivers in polygons (off by default)

# Schema
Each GeoJSON Feature represents a major incident. Each Feature may have multiple geometries using a GeometryCollection. For example both a point and a polygon showing a bushfire extent. Although so far every feature contains at a minimum a point geometry, without any documented guarantees about this consumers should accept features with no geometry or only a polygon geometry.

Each feature has a properties field as follows. Note that these vary from the upstream feed, the full list of possible values is unknown these are just the ones I've come across.
